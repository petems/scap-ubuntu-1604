only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.

To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the
following command:

Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure.

The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system, 
or those designed to be temporary file repositories.  The setting is normally reserved for directories 
used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <code>/tmp</code>), and for directories 
requiring global read/write access.

processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are
listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The rpcbind

servers) then this service should be disabled.

Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a 
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. 
Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength
and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password
helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to 
compromose the password.

<td>Direct root Logins Not Allowed</td>

This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the file does
not exist at all, the root user can login through any communication device on the
system, whether via the console or via a raw network interface. This is dangerous
as user can login to the system as root via Telnet, which sends the password in
plain text over the network. By default, Red Hat Enteprise Linux's
<code>/etc/securetty</code> file only allows the root user to login at the console
physically attached to the system. To prevent root from logging in, remove the
contents of this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
file by typing the following command:

$ sudo echo &gt; /etc/securetty

Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.

Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.</td>
