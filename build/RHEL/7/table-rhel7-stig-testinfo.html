<div style="text-align: center; font-size: normal ">This is a *draft* profile for STIG. This profile is being developed under the DoD consensus model to become a STIG in coordination with DISA FSO.

Where is the RHEL7 STIG?Question: May I deploy a product if no STIG exists?
            Answer: Yes, based on mission need and with DAA approval.
        Question: What do I use if there is no STIG?
            Answer: DISA FSO developed Security Requirement Guides (SRGs) to address technology areas. In the absence of a STIG, an SRG can be used to determine compliance with DoD policies. If there is no applicable SRG or STIG, industry or vendor recommended practices may be used. Examples include Center for Internet Security Benchmarks, Payment Card Industry requirements or the vendor's own security documentation.

With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issue discovered in

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting
passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily

are kepy in plain text.

The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted representations of passwords.

The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as

<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>
