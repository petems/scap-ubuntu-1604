<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>
<a href="https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Encryption.html">https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Encryption.html</a>

laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.

detection.

The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security.

To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match vendor
values, run the following command to list which files on the system
have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va | grep '^..5'</pre>

A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change.  If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.

Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

<code>automount</code> to <code>false</code>, <code>automount-open</code> to <code>false</code>, and
<code>autorun-never</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</code>.
For example:
<pre>[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]

automount-open=false
autorun-never=true</pre>
Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
<code>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</code> to prevent user modification.
For example:
<pre>/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount

After the settings have been set, run <code>dconf update</code>.

<td xml:lang="en-US">The system's default desktop environment, GNOME3, uses

malicious file would exploit the thumbnailer with the potential for malicious code execution. It

<td>Assign Expiration Date to Temporary Accounts</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Temporary accounts are established as part of normal account activation procedures
when there is a need for short-term accounts. In the event temporary 
or emergency accounts are required, configure the system to terminate 
them after a documented time period. For every temporary and
emergency account, run the following command to set an expiration date on it,
substituting <code><i>USER</i></code> and <code><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></code> appropriately:
<pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD USER</i></pre>
<code><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></code> indicates the documented expiration date for the account.
For U.S. Government systems, the operating system must be configured to automatically terminate
these types of accounts after a period of 72 hours.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
If temporary user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for
an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access.
To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all temporary accounts
must be set upon account creation.

<br><br>
Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before
the password is compromised.
<br><br>
Requiring a minimum number of character categories makes password guessing attacks more difficult 
by ensuring a larger search space.

User home directories contain many configuration files which

write permission to another user's home directory. Group shared
directories can be configured in sub-directories or elsewhere in the

should not be world-readable, as it would disclose file names
to other users. If a subset of users need read access
to one another's home directories, this can be provided using

<td>Configure auditd Data Retention</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The audit system writes data to <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code>. By default,
<code>auditd</code> rotates 5 logs by size (6MB), retaining a maximum of 30MB of
data in total, and refuses to write entries when the disk is too
full. This minimizes the risk of audit data filling its partition
and impacting other services. This also minimizes the risk of the audit
daemon temporarily disabling the system if it cannot write audit log (which
it can be configured to do).

For a busy
system or a system which is thoroughly auditing system activity, the default settings
for data retention may be
 insufficient. The log file size needed will depend heavily on what types
of events are being audited. First configure auditing to log all the events of
interest. Then monitor the log size manually for awhile to determine what file
size will allow you to keep the required data for the correct time period.
<br><br>
Using a dedicated partition for <code>/var/log/audit</code> prevents the
<code>auditd</code> logs from disrupting system functionality if they fill, and,
more importantly, prevents other activity in <code>/var</code> from filling the
partition and stopping the audit trail. (The audit logs are size-limited and
therefore unlikely to grow without bound unless configured to do so.) Some
machines may have requirements that no actions occur which cannot be audited.
If this is the case, then <code>auditd</code> can be configured to halt the machine
if it runs out of space. <b>Note:</b> Since older logs are rotated,
configuring <code>auditd</code> this way does not prevent older logs from being
rotated away before they can be viewed.

<i>If your system is configured to halt when logging cannot be performed, make
sure this can never happen under normal circumstances! Ensure that
<code>/var/log/audit</code> is on its own partition, and that this partition is
larger than the maximum amount of data <code>auditd</code> will retain
normally.</i>

instance, the secondary nameserver is not under your control and its
administrators are unwilling to configure TSIG, you can configure an
allow-transfer directive with numerical IP addresses or ACLs as a last resort.
