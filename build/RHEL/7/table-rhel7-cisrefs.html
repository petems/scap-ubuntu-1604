<td>Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The <code>/tmp</code> directory is a world-writable directory used
for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or
logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The <code>/tmp</code> partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
Placing <code>/tmp</code> in its own partition enables the setting of more
restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.
</td>

<tr>
<td>1.1.5</td>
<td>Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The <code>/var</code> directory is used by daemons and other system
services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <code>/var</code> has its own partition
or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Ensuring that <code>/var</code> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
It is not uncommon for the <code>/var</code> directory to contain
world-writable directories installed by other software packages.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.1.7</td>
<td>Ensure /var/log Located On Separate Partition</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
System logs are stored in the <code>/var/log</code> directory.
Ensure that it has its own partition or logical
volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Placing <code>/var/log</code> in its own partition
enables better separation between log files
and other files in <code>/var/</code>.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.1.8</td>
<td>Ensure /var/log/audit Located On Separate Partition</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Audit logs are stored in the <code>/var/log/audit</code> directory.  Ensure that it
has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all
audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Placing <code>/var/log/audit</code> in its own partition
enables better separation between audit files
and other files, and helps ensure that
auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out
of space.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.1.9</td>
<td>Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition
for <code>/home</code> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If
<code>/home</code> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
mountpoint can instead be configured later.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Ensuring that <code>/home</code> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.

<tr>
<td>1.2.2</td>
<td>Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software
packages come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to
receive them), the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed.  
To install the Red Hat GPG key, run:
<pre>$ sudo rhn_register</pre>
If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite,
then install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as
the Red Hat installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted
in <code>/media/cdrom</code>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Changes to software components can have significant effects on the
overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures
the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided 
by a trusted vendor. The Red Hat GPG key is necessary to 
cryptographically verify packages are from Red Hat.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.2.3</td>
<td>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main Yum Configuration</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The <code>gpgcheck</code> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
To configure yum to check package signatures before installing
them, ensure the following line appears in <code>/etc/yum.conf</code> in
the <code>[main]</code> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security 
of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with
and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.
<br>
Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must
be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.
<br>
Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from
a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and
that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed
certificates are disallowed by this requirement. Certificates
used to verify the software must be from an approved Certificate
Authority (CA).
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.7</td>
<td>Ensure Software Patches Installed</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
<pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <code>rpm</code>.
<br><br>
NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner as local policy
dictates.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

<td>Install AIDE</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Install the AIDE package with the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum install aide</pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The AIDE package must be installed if it is to be available for integrity checking.
</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.3.1</td>
<td>Configure Periodic Execution of AIDE</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
At a minimum, AIDE should be configured to run a weekly scan. At most, AIDE should be run daily.
To implement a daily execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to <code>/etc/crontab</code>:
<pre>05 4 * * * root /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
To implement a weekly execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to <code>/etc/crontab</code>:
<pre>05 4 * * 0 root /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
AIDE can be executed periodically through other means; this is merely one example.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
By default, AIDE does not install itself for periodic execution. Periodically
running AIDE is necessary to reveal unexpected changes in installed files.
<br><br>
Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable
to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to
operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may
be relevant to security.
<br><br>
Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,
negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating
system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System
Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or
monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.

<td xml:lang="en-US">The grub2 boot loader should have a superuser account and password
protection enabled to protect boot-time settings.
<br><br>
To do so, select a superuser account and password and add them into the
<code>/etc/grub.d/01_users</code> configuration file.
<br><br>
Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate a hash for the pasword
by running the following command:
<pre>$ grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</pre>
When prompted, enter the password that was selected and insert the returned
password hash into the <code>/etc/grub.d/01_users</code> configuration file
immediately after the superuser account.
(Use the output from <code>grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</code> as the value of
<b>password-hash</b>):
<pre>password_pbkdf2 <b>superusers-account</b> <b>password-hash</b></pre>
NOTE: It is recommended not to use common administrator account names like root,
admin, or administrator for the grub2 superuser account.
<br><br>
To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader superuser account and password MUST
differ from the root account and password.
Once the superuser account and password have been added, update the
<code>grub.cfg</code> file by running:
<pre>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>
NOTE: Do NOT manually add the superuser account and password to the
<code>grub.cfg</code> file as the grub2-mkconfig command overwrites this file.
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures
users with physical access cannot trivially alter
important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,
and whether to enter single-user mode. For more information on how to configure
the grub2 superuser account and password, please refer to

<td>Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server,
open <code>/etc/rsyslog.conf</code> and read and understand the last section of the file,
which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote
logging.
Along with these other directives, the system can be configured
to forward its logs to a particular log server by
adding or correcting one of the following lines,
substituting <code><i>loghost.example.com</i></code> appropriately.
The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system;
although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,
they may not be supported in all environments.
<br>
To use UDP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
<br>
To use TCP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @@<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
<br>
To use RELP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* :omrelp:<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized
place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.
