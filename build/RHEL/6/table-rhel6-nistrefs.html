<td>Encrypt Partitions</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br><br>
For manual installations, select the <code>Encrypt</code> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br><br>
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <code>--encrypted</code> and <code>--passphrase=</code> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <code>--passphrase=</code> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br><br>
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br>
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/chap-Security_Guide-Encryption.html#sect-Security_Guide-LUKS_Disk_Encryption">https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/chap-Security_Guide-Encryption.html#sect-Security_Guide-LUKS_Disk_Encryption</a>

to begin and end the string with <code>"</code>. This command writes
directly either to the <code>/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory/%gconf-tree.xml</code>

Either of these files can later be edited directly if necessary.

address and engage in IP communication without a statically-assigned address or
even a DHCP server. Automatic address assignment via Zeroconf (or DHCP) is not
recommended. To disable Zeroconf automatic route assignment in the 169.254.0.0

<td>Configure auditd Data Retention</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">
The audit system writes data to <code>/var/log/audit/audit.log</code>. By default,
<code>auditd</code> rotates 5 logs by size (6MB), retaining a maximum of 30MB of
data in total, and refuses to write entries when the disk is too
full. This minimizes the risk of audit data filling its partition
and impacting other services. This also minimizes the risk of the audit
daemon temporarily disabling the system if it cannot write audit log (which
it can be configured to do).

For a busy
system or a system which is thoroughly auditing system activity, the default settings
for data retention may be
 insufficient. The log file size needed will depend heavily on what types
of events are being audited. First configure auditing to log all the events of
interest. Then monitor the log size manually for awhile to determine what file
size will allow you to keep the required data for the correct time period.
<br><br>
Using a dedicated partition for <code>/var/log/audit</code> prevents the
<code>auditd</code> logs from disrupting system functionality if they fill, and,
more importantly, prevents other activity in <code>/var</code> from filling the
partition and stopping the audit trail. (The audit logs are size-limited and
therefore unlikely to grow without bound unless configured to do so.) Some
machines may have requirements that no actions occur which cannot be audited.
If this is the case, then <code>auditd</code> can be configured to halt the machine
if it runs out of space. <b>Note:</b> Since older logs are rotated,
configuring <code>auditd</code> this way does not prevent older logs from being
rotated away before they can be viewed.

<i>If your system is configured to halt when logging cannot be performed, make
sure this can never happen under normal circumstances! Ensure that
<code>/var/log/audit</code> is on its own partition, and that this partition is
larger than the maximum amount of data <code>auditd</code> will retain
normally.</i>
